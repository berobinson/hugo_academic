I am currently a City and Regional Planning PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. I work with Dr. Clio Andris at [Friendly Cities Lab](https://friendlycities.gatech.edu/). My research broadly sit in the realm of **urban analytics**. More specifically, I study **spatial and social networks** on various spatial scales: 1) how human activities or cities are organized spatially and socially from network perspectives, and 2) how built environment and point of interests support/suppress human connections in contentious urban space. My approaches are largely inspired by the field of **network science**, **complex system**, and **critical & participatory approaches in GIS and planning**, and therefore ground my research in the pursuit of social inclusion and authentic human connections in the society. 

My dissertation focuses on understanding the costs, tradeoffs, and impacts of material (built environment) infrastructure of spatial and social connectivity in city. I ask what kinds of connectivity are prioritized or supported (by infrastructure), for whom, at what cost, and what can planners do in actions to amplify/mitigate the impacts. While connectivity is the key to a place's influence and growth, it also encodes inequality and exclusion.
