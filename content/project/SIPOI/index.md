title: "Where Does Social Infrastructure Exist Near Subway Stations? A Global Assessment Using OpenStreetMap Data"
summary: In some places, subway stations thrive with social infrastructure, while others find themselves in underdeveloped areas, surrounded by vast parking lots. Where are places where these two infrastructure co-exist, and what factors are associated with the divide?

**Abstract**

Social infrastructure (i.e., third places) and subway stations play crucial roles in sup- porting social connections and transit flows in cities. In certain regions, such as China, Singapore, and Japan, subway station developments are highly sought after, presenting op- portunities for vibrant third places to thrive. Some cultural anthropology scholars even view subway stations as public spaces for social interactions and windows to observe ev- eryday life experiences. Conversely, some subway stations find themselves in underdeveloped areas, surrounded by vast parking lots. 

In this study, we ask two research questions:
- Where does social infrastructure exist near subway stations?
- How do built environment factors (e.g., population density, building area,road length, and car-oriented infrastructure) affect colocation patterns?
