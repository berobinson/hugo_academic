### Fall 2024

[URP 610/UT 402 Urban Networks](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/course/urp610-urban-networks-section-3-fall-2024/)

Cities contain many interconnected networks for infrastructure, human mobility, and relationships. This elective introduces students to concepts and analytical methods for urban network analysis, including conceptualizing, analyzing, and visualizing cities as networks and fostering a critical perspective on how urban networks reflect and reproduce urban inequality. Students will analyze both spatial and social networks and discuss their applications in urban transportation, social justice, and governance. The course will be taught with lectures and hands-on analytical labs. The labs will use Gephi, SNoMaN software, and the R programming language. Prior programming experience is not required but recommended.

[URP 506 Planning Methods](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/course/urp506-planning-methods-section-1-fall-2024/)

This course introduces students to essential methods and techniques used in planning practice and urban research. Analytic approaches include research design, multivariate regression, population forecasting, survey research, case study research, evaluation, and graphic data presentation. The emphasis is on methods in the context of planning and urban policy research, and matching the methods to the problem. We will cover computer applications for data analysis, including some computer lab time scheduled periodically through the semester.

### Winter 2024

[URP 535/UT 402 Introduction to Urban Informatics](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/course/urp535-introduction-to-urban-informatics-section-1-winter-2024/)

This course provides students an introduction to the technical, theoretical and practice-based dimensions of urban informatics, an interdisciplinary field of research and practice that uses data and information technology for the analysis, management, planning, inhabitation, and usability of cities. Situated at the intersection of digital technologies and the human environments, this course situates itself at the emergence of new disciplines— urban science, big data, smart cities, civic technologies among others. The course is centered around technical lectures interspersed with guest presentations and class debates grouped into five topical categories—data acquisition, numerical analysis, mapping and spatialization, visualization and interaction, and civic technologies. Students will also have an opportunity to develop their project—based on their research question—that combines these technical aspects in a final analysis and demonstration. Within the seminar and lecture sessions, we will discuss the policy and design questions around the creation of, and use of urban data within the language of urbanism. Seminar and lecture sessions cover topics related to the context and practice models associated with urban technologies, including civic technology, indicators, smart cities, and performance management.
